### Backlog for "Warning of running the esm-bundler build of vue-i18n for Vue3"
Warning in browser console: "You are running the esm-bundler build of vue-i18n. It is recommended to configure your bundler to explicitly replace feature flag globals with boolean literals to get proper tree-shaking in the final bundle."

This is due to an open issue for Vue3 (https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/issues/789)
